## TASK
Provide a map overview with all venues
Eversports wants their users to stay active and book their sport easily. Therefore it’s important that the users can find a sport venue in their area.
 
## Desired behavior
- Get the list of venues from the server
https://run.mocky.io/v3/7a44e8b3-f3e9-489e-8365-a178bc878b1d
- Create a swift model from the json data
- Show the venues on a map, the user should be able to find out the name and number of courts of the displayed venues

You are allowed to use as many 3rd party libraries as you like to, but you don’t have to use any
 
## Technical Environment
Use Xcode and Swift 5 to create the exercise
